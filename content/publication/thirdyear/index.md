abstract: "The effects of fiscal policy on the economy is increasingly popular in the literature
of empirical macroeconomics and factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR)
models have become a popular tool in explaining how economic variables interact
over time.This paper focused on the effect of fiscal policy on aggregate and dis-
aggregated consumption by applying the factor-augmented vector autoregression
(FAVAR) model. The study specifically estimated the FAVAR model using the
computationally simpler principal component method. The result shows that con-
sumption increases after government spending shock. Also, there is heterogeneous
effects within disaggregated consumption variables resulting from government spend-
ing shock.
