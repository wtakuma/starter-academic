abstract: "Ghanaâ€™s desire to achieve sustainable economic growth with relatively stable price
level pursue both monetary and fiscal policies that could lead to macroeconomic. This
study examines the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth and
determine the level of convergence of growth for Ghana by applying structural equation
modeling (SEM) using time series data from 2008 to 2017. Both short run and long-run
results revealed that the ratio of government spending to private investment was
statistically significant and it exerted a positive impact on economic growth, an indication
that government expenditure is a key channel through which economic growth can be
achieved. It was also revealed that real interest rate which is a monetary policy tool have a
negative effect on economic growth in Ghana. The study also revealed that government
spending shocks decreases private investment in Ghana, which results in crowding out in
the economy. It was recommended that to achieve higher and sustainable economic growth,
government must embark on expansionary fiscal policies through investment in
infrastructure development to create jobs and generate income tax to finance other
developmental projects. Also, the Bank of Ghana must reduce its lending rates to
encourage private sector development to enhance growth and development of the economy
