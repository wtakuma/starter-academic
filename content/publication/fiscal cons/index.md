abstract = "This paper investigates the effects of fiscal policy on asset prices using structural dynamic factor model (SDFM) with cointegrated factors. %Much of the focus in the literature were on monetary policy and asset prices, with little attention to fiscal policy. The literature highlighted the importance of asset markets over the business cycle, but little focus on how fiscal policy actions impact asset prices.  %Also, structural VAR (SVAR) appears to be the widely used method in the literature with regards to policy innovations, but they are prone to limited information and non-invertibility problem. In this paper I estimated the impulse response functions (IRFs) of stock price and house to government spending shocks using a quarterly dataset with 207 macroeconomic and financial variables obtained from St. Louis FRED website. %The factors were extracted using principal components applied to the non-stationary data and an unrestricted VAR is specified with the non-stationary factors to account for cointegration in the SDFM framework. Scree plots and information criteria were used to determine the number of factors to include in the model. Government spending shock was identified by combining “named factor normalization” and “unit effect normalization” and applying Cholesky decomposition. It was revealed that the common factors explained substantial variation in real variables, implying that the factors were able to capture changes in the business cycle. %It was also noted that the common factors explained smaller variation in house prices, which indicate that house price are driven by local dynamics. The results of the IRFs shows that both stock price and house price responded positively to government spending shock and the effects were persistent and not temporal as suggested in the literature. %Results from forecast error variance decomposition shows that government spending shock explained high percentage of the forecast error variance in real GDP, consumption, and fixed investment. This paper highlighted the importance of allowing cointegration among factors within the SDFM framework and the role played by using larger datasets in resolving the limited information problems inherent in SVAR analysis. The results implies that fiscal policy leads to a boom in housing and stock markets"
